## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Web Components API
- Tailwind
- Vite


### What I learned

Web Components are quite nice and could come in handy in some situations. But are best used for content that needs to be completely seperate from the rest of the page so as to fully utilize the shadow dom property.
